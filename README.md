# Movie Recommendation and Web Scraping

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files for two different tasks: movie recommendation and web scraping.

## Movie Recommendation

The `Movie_recommendation.ipynb` notebook implements a movie recommendation system. It likely utilizes a dataset of movies and user ratings to provide personalized recommendations to users. The specific algorithm and approach used for recommendation may vary.

## Web Scraping

### Wiki Info-box Scraping

The `Wiki Info-box scraping.ipynb` notebook focuses on scraping structured information from Wikipedia pages, particularly infoboxes. It utilizes packages such as BeautifulSoup, Requests, and wget to extract the required information in a structured format. This piece of code is designed to scrape information from a single web page.

### Scraping Multiple Results

The `scraping_multiple_results.ipynb` notebook demonstrates web scraping with a focus on crawling multiple pages from a main URL. It initializes a crawler to retrieve data from multiple pages, likely for purposes such as data collection or analysis.

## Usage

To use these notebooks:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Movie-Recommendation-and-Web-Scraping.git
   
2. Open the desired Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab) and execute the code cells within each notebook according to the provided instructions to perform the respective tasks.

### Dependencies
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed for running the code in each notebook. These dependencies may include Python packages like BeautifulSoup, Requests, and wget for web scraping tasks, and any additional libraries required for movie recommendation algorithms.
